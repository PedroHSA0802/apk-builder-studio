## 🚀 Features

### 🔧 Fully Automated Setup
*No terminal, no prompts.* **APK Builder Studio** sets up the entire Android build environment automatically — without requiring the user to open a terminal or enter any commands:

* **Automatic Installation:** Configuration of WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux).
* **Toolchain Setup:** Full installation of Android SDK, NDK, and Build-tools.
* **Environment:** Automatic creation and activation of a Python virtual environment (`venv`).
* **Structure:** Intelligent placement of all required folders in the correct hierarchy.
* **Sync:** Automatic synchronization between the Windows file system and WSL.

> **Note:** The user does not need to perform any manual installations. Everything runs seamlessly in the background.

### 📁 Project & Structure Management
* **Create & Manage:** Easily start new Kivy/KivyMD projects with the correct folder structure.
* **Smart Detection:** Automatically detect and repair missing or incorrect project folders.
* **Path Optimization:** Synchronize files between Windows and WSL to avoid build errors caused by incorrect file paths.

---

### 🧩 Template-Based Configuration
* **Smart Templates:** Assign pre-defined build templates to your projects.
* **Customization:** Save your own templates for repeated builds.
* **Ease of Use:** Edit templates as simple text files directly within the interface.

---

### 📦 APK Build with Buildozer
* **GUI-Driven:** Automatically runs Buildozer inside WSL without the need for terminal commands.
* **Real-time Monitoring:** Displays build logs and progress directly in the app.
* **Organized Output:** Stores generated APKs in a clean and structured output folder.

✍️ A Note from the Developer (License & Future)

Hi! I’m the developer of this tool. I built it because the APK build process used to give me massive headaches, and I wanted a solution that just works for everyone.

Why a license key? Even though the app is currently free, I’ve included a license system to help me manage the community and growth while I’m still refining the software.

Will it cost money later? To be honest: I don't know yet. Maybe it will always be free, maybe there will be a small fee for new users later. But here’s the deal: If you get a key during this beta phase, the app stays free for you forever. No subscriptions, no hidden costs – even for all future updates and "Pro" features.

🔥 Coming Soon: The Integrated USB Debugger

I'm already working on the next big update:
One-Click Debugging: 
Just plug your phone into your PC via USB.

Live Logcat: See exactly why your app is crashing on the device.

Python Error Filter: No more digging through thousands of lines of system logs. The app will highlight the specific Python error causing the crash.

🔒 License & Connectivity
Activation: Requires a one-time internet connection to link your key to an anonymous hardware-hash (valid for up to 2 devices).

Setup: Internet access is needed during the first run to automatically download the required Android components (WSL, SDK, NDK).
